### About
The FYP focuses in the development of a 3D indie game using VR. The game is a single player (first person), survival game. The entire idea, the storyline, the design of the scene and the code implementation are originally developed by me. The project was implemented in **Unity** using **C#** for scripting, and was based on an Agile methodology and uses the principles of Object-Oriented Programming. Detailed information of the dissertation, including literuture review, methodology, testing, and more can be found in the **"final report.pdf"**. The scripts are provided only for observation, to play the game read the "Instructions" section below. For the best understanding of the scripting, methodology, and design, refer to the **"Methodology"** section in the "final report.pdf". The **"gameplay demo.mp4"** is provided to illustrate the in-game experience, and briefly explains most of the features developed. The recorder limited the view and the quality of the graphics in the video, in contrast with the actual VR experience.

### Instructions
To play the game extract the **"FYPGame.zip"** and run the **"FYP.exe"** file. The game requires the use of a **VR headset and controllers by Oculus**. UI such as Main Menu, Game Over Screen, and Pause Menu, appears on the PC screen and the user can interact with the UI buttons using the mouse. The controller instructions, to play the game can be found in the "manual" section of the Main Menu.
